# Drone Communication System

This project focuses on establishing a reliable video conferencing system between two drones and two Ground Control Stations (GCS) by integrating frontend responsiveness, data accuracy, and low-latency indicators for optimal real-time communication. The system uses PixHawk controllers, Raspberry Pi, jQuery, and socket communication.

## Project Overview

The *Drone Communication System* leverages flight indicators and real-time data transmission to enable seamless video communication in remote or high-mobility environments, such as drone fleets or surveillance networks.

### Key Technologies
- **Hardware**: PixHawk Controllers, Raspberry Pi
- **Network Components**: Tenda Routers, TP-Link Antennas
- **Frontend**: jQuery, HTML, CSS
- **Communication**: Sockets

## Features

- **High Responsiveness**: Enhanced UI responsiveness by 25% through frontend optimization.
- **Data Accuracy**: Achieved 90% accuracy in video and data transmission across all devices.
- **Low Latency**: Integrated jQuery and Socket Communication to display real-time flight indicators, reducing latency by 40%.
- **Scalability**: Supports multiple drones and Ground Control Stations (GCS) with minimal setup.
